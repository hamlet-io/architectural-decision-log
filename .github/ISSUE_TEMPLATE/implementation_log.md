## Implementation Log - <ADR Id>
<!-- ADR Id is the id of the accepted ADR -->

This ticket tracks the implementation of an ADR and acts as a record of action.

Any Pull Request which relates to the decision should be linked to this Log ticket to show how the ADR is going from its implementation.

This ticket can be closed once the maintainers are satisfied that the ADR has been implemented based on its accepted record.

This ticket should not cover discussions around new ADRs and should only focus on the implementation of what has been accepted.
